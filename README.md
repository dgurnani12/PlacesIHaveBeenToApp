# README: PlacesIHaveBeenToApp

An android app that I've made to explore specific android studio concepts for more advanced apps.

This app is an aid tool to help you keep track of places you've been to, using the location service.

Simply add a new place from the list in the main page, once the google maps activity is loaded, then tap on the place you would like to store as a place you've been to directly on the map. You should now see a well organized list of places you've been to along with alot of other cool details.

features I am trying to work on:

TODO: share such places details on social media in a presentable fashion.

TODO: friends places tab, where you have access to a list of places your friends have been who are also using the app.

TODO: send your place to a friend
